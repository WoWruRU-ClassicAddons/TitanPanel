Installation:
=============
Hopefully, you will have unpacked this .rar preserving the file structure. If you have, you can simply upload 
the contents of the "TitanFriends" file into the World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns directory (usually found
in the C:/ Drive


Slash Commands:
===============
You can use /titanfriends or /tf as a slash command. Place the following options after the slash commands (/tf showoffline
for example):

showoffline - this will show your offline friends in the tooltip
showignored - this will show your ignore list in the tooltip
showclass - this will show your online friends class in the tooltip


Credits:

Original concept and idea by Kragus & Windrunner
Version 0.9.1 and onwards by Kiltek
Thank to KirynSilverwing (v0.9.1 - ? BETA Tester)


Future expansions:
==================
*Friend-in-zone Alert When a friend enters your zone and alert can be bought up either as a splash screen (like CTRA's 
on screen messages from raid leaders) and/or as a message in the default chat frame with the same sound used as the 
incoming whisper (obviously how the messages are displayed can be toggled, or the feature switched off)

*Answering Machine If you're AFK or DND (and really really do not want to be disturbed) then the answering machine will 
remember all whispers that have come through, store them, and let you view them whenever you want or when you return to 
the normal status. The button would flash when you have new messages or something like that. You could also filter who's 
whispers the machine will store (friends or non friends) etc etc.

    class' raid color.
  * showignored - will show your ignored list.

# Previous "todo" addressed and new/old todo's:
